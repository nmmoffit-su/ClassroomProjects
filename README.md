# Portfolio

Hello, this is the portfolio showcasing some of the work I have done in and out of classrooms, as I have learned more and more about web design. Some of the files include work I have done in basic HTML structuring, CSS selections, utiliziing Bootstrap components, and dabbling in JavaScript.
